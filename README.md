Literature Review
1.	Introduction and Motivation
1-2 para. 
This paper is mainly about security of commercial VPN. As the internet grows and Virtual Private Network is an important technique and had risen significantly especially after the breakout of pandemic when working remotely was necessary for companies. Generally, VPN is mostly used when users want to pass some blocks or change their IP addresses, or employees need to connect to networks of their institutions. However, as the VPN are widely used, problems came along with the growth.
The first VPN model was developed by Microsoft back in 1996. At that point, VPN was used by companies so that employees could get access to self-owned data safely. The basic idea is packing the origin data in a new header and when it’s received, it will be unpacked through a protocol, which receiver and sender had agreed on.
Later some of the VPN users started using VPN to get across some blocks or firewall. Most of these users are facing many challenges.
Given the incidents happened years ago such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN. Researchers and public began to look at privacy risks in using the VPN.
Imagine a situation when you are quarenteened, but need to get access to networks of company to retrieve some unpublic data. Normally employees need to connect to Wi-Fi in their company and acquire data.
Currently, most of papers focus on performance of VPN while ignoring privacy risks. Commercial VPN products can be seen everywhere. That’s why researches related to privacy and security should be conducted not only to regulate this field if commerce but also rise consumer’s awareness of protecting their own privacy.
